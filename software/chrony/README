build_dpkg.sh is a script to build a Debian package of chrony.

The idea is to build chrony on a system with the pps-tools installed, so that
chrony is built against /usr/include/sys/time-pps.h and will therefore
contain a PPS reference driver.

Then on a data system, create an apt-get preferences file called
/etc/apt/preferences.d/chrony.conf, looking like so:

Explanation: Make sure we get chrony from the EOL repository
Package: chrony
Pin: release l=EOL
